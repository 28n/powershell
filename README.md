# Powershell

![PWSH](https://github.com/28n/assets/blob/main/powershell/pwsh.png?raw=true)

Yea, welcome to these damn bad Powershell Configs. I dont know how to install this, so just dont use it.

If youre good at Powershell and Windows Stuff, go for it.

## Current Functions

- Cool Oh-my-posh setup (not used tho)

- cool starship setup (used)

- cool set-alias setup (also used)

- fzf and psreadline

- cluttered and bloated config-file
